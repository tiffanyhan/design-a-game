## Test the API with Google API Explorer:
 - https://apis-explorer.appspot.com/apis-explorer/?base=https://skeleton-game.appspot.com/_ah/api

## Local Set-Up Instructions:
1.  Make sure you have the Python Google App Engine SDK installed and configured
 on your machine.
2.  Update the value of application in app.yaml to a app ID you have registered
 in the App Engine admin console and would like to use to host your instance of this sample.
3.  Run the app with the devserver using dev_appserver.py DIR, and ensure it's
 running by visiting the API Explorer - by default localhost:8080/_ah/api/explorer.

 ## Quickstart:
  - create a new user using the endpoint 'create_user'
  - create a new game using the endpoint 'new_game'.  copy the 'urlsafe_key' returned.
  - make a guess using the endpoint 'make_move'.  you will need to input the 'urlsafe_key' you copied previously in the required field.

## Game Description:
Hangman is a word guessing game. Each game begins with a random word, and a maximum number of
'attempts'.  The number of letters in the target word and the maximum number of attempts can
both be specified by the user (as of now, the allowed number of letters in the target word
are 5, 6, or 7). The allowed number of attempts only decreases when you make
a wrong guess. 'Guesses' are sent to the `make_move` endpoint which will reply with the
following information:

 - 'word'
    - before any guess is made, the initial state of 'word' is all blank spaces
    - letters replace the appropriate blank space(s) when a guess is correct
 - 'hit' (true if the guess was correct)
 - 'attempts_remaining'
 - 'game over' (if the maximum number of attempts is reached, or the correct word is guessed).

Many different Hangman games can be played by many different Users at any
given time. Each game can be retrieved or played by using the path parameter
`urlsafe_game_key`.

Individual games are ranked according to its score's attempts_remaining attribute.
Note that this is different from a game's attempts_remaining attribute.  The
attribute for a game is a whole number that decrements during the course of the
game.  The attribute for a score is a decimal value calculated after the game
is over, using the game's final attempts_remaining value divided by the number of
attempts_allowed.  Ties are broken according to the number of letters of the
target word.  A longer word corresponds to a higher score, while a shorter word
corresponds to a lower score.

Users are ranked according to their number of wins relative to the total number of games
they have played (calculated as a decimal value).  Ties are broken according to a user's
average_attempts_remaining attribute.  A higher number of attempts remaining throughout
all games played corersponds to a higher score, while a lower number of attempts
remaining throughout all games played corresponds to a lower score.
